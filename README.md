Open Aid Geocoder
============= 

Open Aid Geocoder helps users to assign precise geospatial data on the locations of development projects. 
The tool is composed by two main component a pure Javascript React Based UI, that can be plugged into an existing system, and an API that together with the UI can make Open Aid Geocoder work as an standalone application.
The geocoder and auto geocoder can run together connected to the same database  to enable manual geocode to send aid project to the autogecode job queue and be able to automatically geocode the imported activities.
